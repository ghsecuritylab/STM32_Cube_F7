@par Application Description

This application describes how to display pictures on LCD saved under USB disk.
 
Prior to starting the application, the user has to create a "/Media" directory under the micro USB disk root and
copy the pictures stored in PC directory "Utilities/Media/Pictures".
    The images should have the following properties:
     file type    : *.bmp
     resolution   : up to 240x240.
     pixel format : RGB565
     file name    : up to 7 characters
 
@note : The user can add pictures of his choice but the file type, resolution
        and pixel format described below must be respected.
  
  Once the LCD, USB and file systems initialized and configured, 
  a content check of the "Media" directory is done and the number of ".BMP" files 
  is retained.
  
@note : An associate LCD discovery driver is used in this application 
  
@note : The maximum number of BMP files is fixed to 25. It can be raised 
        until reaching the maximum of USB memory space.

  The following steps are performed to scroll all the images stored in the 
  USB disk :
 
  Step1 :
  ------
  The image copied from USB disk to LCD frame buffer located in PSRAM memory. The
  image is the displayed when the lCD memory is refreshed.
  Each image is displayed 2 seconds
 
  Step2 :
  ------
  When all image are displayed, the image counter is reset and the images are
  displayed again.
      
@note 
  => If the "Media" directory is empty, a warning message is displayed on 
     the LCD : "  No Bitmap files...  

  => If the file type stored in the "Media" directory is not supported,
     a warning message is displayed on the LCD : " No Bitmap files... "
    
  => If the USB disk is removed while running the application, a warning message
     is displayed on the LCD. The application restart once the USB disk is pluged
     again.
   
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.


@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This application runs on STM32F723xx/STM32F733xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F723E-DISCO
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    
  - STM32F723E-DISCO Set-up
    - Plug the USB key into the STM32F723IE_DISCOVERY board through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Female' cable (HS mode: connector CN19).
    - USB_HS jumper should be fitted on CN8 connector.


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - The bitmap images, available under ".Media/" 
   should be copied inside a  dedicated directory named "Media" at USB key root.
   The images should have the following properties:
     file type    : *.bmp
     resolution   : up to 240x240
     pixel format : RGB565    
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
