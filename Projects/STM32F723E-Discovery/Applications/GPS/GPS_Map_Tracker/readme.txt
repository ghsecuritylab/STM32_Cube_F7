@par Application Description 

This application shows how to use the Nano GPS Click module plugged on Fanout board connected 
to STM32F723E-Discovery via STMOD+ to perform a real time positioning using STM32 Cube HAL.

The GPS map tracker contains a GPS module to receive the GPS signal and calculate the coordinates

This application communicate via St-link as VCP with GoogleEarth application installed on PC.
(See Hardware and Software environment section below)

The global positioning system is a satellite navigation system that uses multiple 
satellite signals to find a receiver’s position on earth. 

The GPS receivers use NMEA standard protocol to transmit data.
The GPS Frame is a sequence of characters containing geolocation information such as:
  - The latitude, longitude,
  - Speed, altitude
  - The number of satellites
  - Time, date
  
NMEA sentences are all ASCII, RS-232 compatible and are transmitted as frame at Baudrate 4800.
Each frame begins with the character $ followed by a group of 2 letters for the 
identifier of the receiver. Then a group of 3 letters for the identifier of the frame.
It ends with a carriage return linefeed (<CR><LF>). Data is comma delimited. 

GPS Frame Examples:
   $GPGGA - Global Positioning System Fix Data
   $GPGSA - GPS DOP and active satellites 
   $GPGSV - GPS Satellites in view
   $GPRMC - Recommended minimum specific GPS/Transit data

At startup, the LCD, ToochScreen and GPS module are initialized, and a message displayed. 
In case of fail, LED5 is blinking and an ERROR message is displayed on the LCD screen.

@note: Comment LCD_USE define in main.h file to disable the display on LCD.
  
Nano GPS click receiver finds this location by coordinating information from at 
least three satellite signals. 
It produces a NMEA frame. This frame is then sent to STM32F723xx via a serial link. 
Once this frame is decoded, the useful information (num of Sat, time, date, Longitude, 
Altitude, latitude, speed) are displayed on the LCD. 
If the GoogleEarth Application is runing on PC, the received frame is sent to PC 
via VCP( St-link in this application) and the correspondig location on Google earth map on run time.

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F723XX devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with the following environment:
     - STM32F723E_DISCOVERY Rev-C 01 board. 
     - Nano GPS click module plugged on STM32F723E_DISCOVERY through connector CN10, CN11.
	 
  - Environment Setup
    - Connect the Fanout Board MB1280 to STMOD+ connector (P1).
    - Plug Nano GPS click module on connector CN11 and CN10. Make sure that the Green PWR LED on the Nano Click Board is on.
    - Connect the STM32F723E_Discovery To PC via ST link CN1.
    - Open Google Earth Application on the PC.
    - Menu Tools => GPS => Realtime => Automatically follow => Start

@note: Note that Google Earth will not detect GPS COM port until you have a GPS fix.

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Check that DK board is connected to a remote PC before running the application
 - Run the application
