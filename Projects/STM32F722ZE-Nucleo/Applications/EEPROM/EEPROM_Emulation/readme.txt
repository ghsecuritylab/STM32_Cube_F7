@par Application Description 

This application shows how to emulate EEPROM on internal flash.

Please refer to AN3969 for futher details regarding this application.

NUCLEO-F722ZE board LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED2 is On when the application runs successfully.
  - LED2 is toggle in case of error.
  
@note It's recommended to deactivate CPU Data Cache. The EEPROM algorithm includes 
      many flash erase operations which may make data in cache and physical memory not aligned.
      In case of enabling CPU Data Cache, user should invalidate data cache every read operation 
      from Flash memory or configuring MPU as device. Then, it will impact seriously the application performance.
 
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
      
@note Before using the application, ensure that dedicated sectors for EEPROM are erased
      to avoid a match with a valid page OPCODE.

@par Keywords

EEPROM, Emulation, Flash, Program, Erase, Sectors, OPCODE

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F722ZE devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with NUCLEO-F722ZE board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
