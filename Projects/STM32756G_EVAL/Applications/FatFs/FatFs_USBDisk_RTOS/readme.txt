@par Application Description

This application provides a description on how to use STM32Cube firmware with FatFs 
middleware component as a generic FAT file system module, FreeRTOS as an RTOS
module based on using CMSIS-OS wrapping layer common APIs, and also STM32 USB 
On-The-Go (OTG) host library, in Full Speed (FS), High Speed (HS) and High Speed 
in Full Speed (HS-IN-FS) modes, in order to develop an application exploiting 
FatFs offered features with USB disk drive in RTOS mode configuration.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 216 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock which is coming from a specific output of two PLLs: main PLL or PLL SAI.
In the High Speed (HS) mode the USB clock (60 MHz) is driven by the ULPI.

The 48 MHz clock for the USB FS can be derived from one of the two following sources:
  – PLL clock (clocked by the HSE): If the USB uses the PLL as clock source, the PLL VCO clock must be programmed
    to output 336 MHz frequency (USBCLK = PLLVCO/PLLQ).
  – PLLSAI clock (clocked by the HSE): If the USB uses the PLLSAI as clock source, the PLLSAI VCO clock must be programmed
    to output 384 MHz frequency (USBCLK = PLLSAIVCO/PLLSAIP).
           
The application is based on writing a text file to a drive, it creates a normal 
priority thread, that executes a Mass Storage Class routine and it's performed 
using FatFs APIs to access the FAT volume as described in the following steps:  

 - Link the USB Host disk I/O driver;
 - Register the file system object (mount) to the FatFs module for the USB drive;
 - Create and Open new text file object with write access;
 - Write data to the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Open text file object with read access;
 - Read back data from the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Check on read data from text file;
 - Unlink the USB Host disk I/O driver.
 
It is worth noting that the application manages any error occurred during the 
access to FAT volume, when using FatFs APIs. Otherwise, user can check if the
written text file is available on the USB disk.

It is possible to fine tune needed FatFs features by modifying defines values 
in FatFs configuration file “ffconf.h” available under the project includes 
directory, in a way to fit the application requirements. 

STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED1 is ON when the application runs successfully.
  - LED3 is ON when any error occurs.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set accordingly to the 
      OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.
      
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

on STM32Cube with FatFs".

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM327x6G_EVAL 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM327x6G_EVAL Set-up
    - Plug the USB key into the STM327x6G_EVAL board through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Female' cable to the connector:
      - CN8 : to use USB High Speed (HS) 
      - CN13: to use USB Full Speed (FS) with embedded PHY(U8)
              Please ensure that jumper JP8 is not fitted.
      - CN14: to use USB HS-IN-FS.
              Note that some FS signals are shared with the HS ULPI bus, so some PCB rework is needed.
              For more details, refer to section USB OTG2 HS & FS in STM327x6G_EVAL user manual for details.

     - Ensure that JP24 is in position 2-3 to use LED1.
     - Ensure that JP23 is in position 2-3 to use LED3.
