@par Application Description 
  
This application is a part of the USB Host Library package using STM32Cube firmware. It describes how to use
USB host application based on the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) on the STM32F7x6 devices.

MTP is used to transfer data between computer/Host and devices connected to it. This protocol was 
developed for intelligent storage devices for downloading photographs from digital cameras music files
on digital audio players and media files on portable media players.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 200 Mhz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock which is coming from a specific output of two PLLs: main PLL or PLL SAI.
In the High Speed (HS) mode the USB clock (60 MHz) is driven by the ULPI.
 
When the application is started, the connected device (Android devices: Smartphone, Tablet...) 
is detected in MTP mode and gets initialized.
The STM32 MCU behaves as a MTP Host, it enumerates the device and extracts VID, PID, manufacturer name,
Serial number and product name information and displays it on the LCD screen. 
Then the Host detects the number of storage devices and displays on the LCD screen. The user will have 
to copy the .wav files on the root of the default storage. Only the files present on this space are visible 
by the application.

A menu is displayed and the user can select any operation from the menu using the Joystick buttons:
 - "Explore audio file" operation searches for all MTP objects, here are .Wav files and displays them 
    on the LCD screen.
 - "Start audio Player" operation starts playing the song from selected storage device.
   This application uses the I2S interface to stream audio data from USB Host to the audio codec implemented 
   on the evaluation board. Then audio downstream is driven to headphone or speaker.
   The USBH_AUDIO_ChangeOutBuffer() API is called while playing songs and the bytes are stored in a 
   circular buffer. Sampling frequency, Channels number and File size (duration) are detected. 
   The audio.c file contains a set of APIs for Audio Out playback, for example when the WAV file is 
   playing, the USBH_AUDIO_SetVolume() API is called to change the volume settings. 
 - "Re-Enumerate" operation performs a new Enumeration of the device.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

For more details about the STM32Cube USB Host library, please refer to UM1720  
"STM32Cube USB Host library".

@note The application is compliant with the MTP implementation for the Android 4.0.x/ 4.1.x/4.2.x and 4.3.x
      with USB debug mode disabled on the device.

@note The STM32F7xx devices can reach a maximum clock frequency of 216MHz but as this application uses SDRAM,
      the system clock is limited to 200MHz. Indeed proper functioning of the SDRAM is only guaranteed 
      at a maximum system clock frequency of 200MHz.

@par USB Library Configuration

To select the appropriate USB Core to work with, user must add the following macro defines within the
compiler preprocessor (already done in the preconfigured projects provided with this application):
      - "USE_USB_HS" when using USB High Speed (HS) Core
      - "USE_USB_FS" when using USB Full Speed (FS) Core 
      - "USE_USB_HS" and "USE_USB_HS_IN_FS" when using USB High Speed (HS) Core in FS mode

It is possible to fine tune needed USB Host features by modifying defines values in USBH configuration
file “usbh_conf.h” available under the project includes directory, in a way to fit the application
requirements, such as:
- Level of debug: USBH_DEBUG_LEVEL
                  0: No debug messages
                  1: Only User messages are shown
                  2: User and Error messages are shown
                  3: All messages and internal debug messages are shown
   By default debug messages are displayed on the debugger IO terminal; to redirect the Library
   messages on the LCD screen, lcd_log.c driver need to be added to the application sources.

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM327x6G-EVAL RevB
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM327x6G-EVAL RevB Set-up
    - Plug the MTP device into the STM327x6G-EVAL board through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Female' cable to the connector:
      - CN8 : to use USB High Speed (HS) 
      - CN13: to use USB Full Speed (FS)
      - CN14: to use USB HS-IN-FS.
              Note that some FS signals are shared with the HS ULPI bus, so some PCB rework is needed.
              For more details, refer to section "USB OTG2 HS & FS" in STM327x6G-EVAL Evaluation Board 
              User Manual.
        @note Make sure that :
         - jumper JP8 must be removed when using USB OTG FS
    - Use CN26 connector to connect the board to external headset
    - Please ensure that jumpers JP4 and JP5 are fitted in position 2-3 (I2S)
    - Load .wav audio file (audio_sample.wav) available under "/Utilities/Media/Audio" to the root of MTP device
