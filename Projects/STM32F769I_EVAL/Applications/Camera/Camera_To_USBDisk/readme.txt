@par Application Description

This application provides a short description of how to use the DCMI to interface with
camera module and display in continuous mode the picture on LCD and to save a picture 
in USB device.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 200 MHz.

The Digital camera interface is configured to receive the capture from
the camera module mounted on STM32F769I_EVAL evaluation board.
DMA2 Stream1 channel1 is configured to transfer the picture from DCMI peripheral
to an external RAM used by the LCD as a frame buffer.   

The camera module is configured to generate (480x272) image resolution
and the LCD is configured to display in resolution WVGA(800x480) in orientation landscape.

When the tamper button is pressed an image is saved under USBdisk.
  - LED1 is on to indicate the end of saving operation and a message is displayed 
    on LCD to indicate the beginning and the end of the saving operation.
  - LED3 is ON when any error occurs.
  
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Keywords

Display, Camera, USB Disk, DCMI, LCD, DMA, Frame buffer, WVGA

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”

@par Hardware and Software environment
  
  - This application runs on STM32F769xx and STM32F779xx devices.
  
  - This application has been tested with STM32F769I-EVAL board which includes
    the KoD DSI LCD and S5K5CAG camera module.

  - STM32F769I-EVAL Set-up
    - Plug the USB key into the STM32F769I-EVAL board through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Female' cable (HS mode: connector CN8).
    - Make sure jumper JP10 of STM32F769I-EVAL board is not fitted.
    
    
@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
