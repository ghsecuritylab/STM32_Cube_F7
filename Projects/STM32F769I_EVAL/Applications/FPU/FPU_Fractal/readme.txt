@par Application Description
  
  This application explains how to use, and demonstrates the benefits brought by, the STM32F7 floating-point
  units (FPU). The CortexM7 FPU is an implementation of the ARM FPv5-SP double-precision FPU.
  
  The application computes a simple mathematical fractal: the Julia set.
  The generation algorithm for such a mathematical object is quite simple: for each point of
  the complex plan, we are evaluating the divergence speed of a defined sequence. The Julia
  set equation for the sequence is: z(n+1) = z(n)^2 + c.
  This value is translated into a color, to show graphically the divergence speed of the points of the complex plan.
  
  Two workspaces are available to activate or not the FPU during the compilation phase:
  - Without using the FPU, these operations are done by software through the C compiler
  library and are not visible to the programmer; but the performances are very low.
  - When enabling the FPU, all of the real numbers calculations are entirely done by hardware in a
  single cycle, for most of the instructions. The C compiler does not use its own floating-point
  library but directly generates FPU native instructions.
  
  User might change the number of iterations done while calculating the fractal for richer pixels generated,
  by chngaing the ITERATION define in main.h
  
  STM32F769I-EVAL Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED1 is ON in case of success.

@note For more information on how to use floating-point units (FPU) refer to AN4044 found under:
      http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/en/resource/technical/document/application_note/DM00047230.pdf

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F767xx/STM32F769xx/STM32F777xx/STM32F779xx Devices.
  
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F769I-EVAL 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it? 

      In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Select FPU On or FPU Off workspace
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the application
