@par Example Description

This directory contains a set of sources files and pre-configured projects that 
describes how to build an application to be loaded into Flash memory using
In-Application Programming (IAP, through USART).

If the flash configuration is Dual bank mode uncomment the #define USE_DUAL_BANK_FLASH in main.h to download, upload
and execute the binary file on a dual bank flash, otherwise the default flash configuration is a Single bank flash.

@note You have to initially configure the FLASH memory at Single or Dual Bank mode using STM32 ST-LINK 
      Utilities or any similar tool (check "nDBANK" box) according to the flash mode selected on main.h.

@note Using the Dual bank mode, the firmware code is executed from Sector0 on Bank1 and the download/upload
      operations are done on Bank2.

@par Keywords

Middleware, IAP, In-Application Programming, Dual Bank, Binary, Flash memory, USART

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”

(1) User application location address is defined in the flash_if.h file as: 
      -Dual Bank flash:   #define APPLICATION_ADDRESS           ((uint32_t)0x08100000)
      -Single Bank flash: #define APPLICATION_ADDRESS           ((uint32_t)0x08008000)

      -Dual Bank flash:   #define USER_FLASH_END_ADDRESS           ((uint32_t)0x08100000)
      -Single Bank flash: #define USER_FLASH_END_ADDRESS           ((uint32_t)0x08008000)
To modify it, change the default value to the desired one. Note that the application must be linked
relatively to the new address too.

  - STM32F769I-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the boards DB9 connector 
      CN7 (USART1) and PC serial port.
      (make sure that jumper JP11 is fitted).
    - Hold the Tamper push-button during reset to enter the IAP.   

  - Terminal configuration: 
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None 
    - Ymodem protocol is using CRC16 by default. To switch to checksum, comment #define CRC16_F
      in ymodem.c

@par How to use it? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

  1. Generate a binary image for the program provided in the "IAP/IAP_SingleBank_Binary_Template"
     or "IAP/IAP_DualBank_Binary_Template" project directory. 
  2. Program the internal Flash with the IAP (see below) 
  3. Open HyperTerminal window using the settings already defined in section
     "Hardware and Software environment" 
  4. To run the IAP driver, keep the Tamper push-button pressed at Reset. 
     The IAP main menu is then displayed on the HyperTerminal window.
  5. To download an application, press 1 and use the Ymodem protocol

In order to load the IAP code, you have do the following:
   - EWARM:
      - Open the Project.eww workspace
      - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
      - Load project image: Project->Debug
      - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)
